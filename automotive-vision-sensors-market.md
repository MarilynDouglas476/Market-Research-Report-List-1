<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Vision Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monocular Vision</li><li>Binocular (stereo) Vision</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive vision sensors market is divided into two primary types: monocular vision and binocular (stereo) vision. Monocular vision uses a single camera to capture images and analyze them for tasks like object detection and lane departure warning, making it simpler and cost-effective. In contrast, binocular vision employs two cameras to provide depth perception through stereo imaging, enabling more advanced functionalities such as 3D mapping and improved obstacle detection. Both types are essential for enhancing vehicle safety and automation.</p></p>
