<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Quantitative PCR Kit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Probe-Based</li><li>SYBR Green</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The quantitative PCR (qPCR) kit market is primarily divided into two types: probe-based and SYBR Green. Probe-based assays use specific fluorescent probes to detect target DNA sequences, allowing for higher specificity and multiplexing capabilities. SYBR Green, on the other hand, is a dye that binds to double-stranded DNA, providing a simpler and more cost-effective solution but with less specificity. Each type caters to different research needs, balancing efficiency, accuracy, and budget considerations in various applications.</p></p>
