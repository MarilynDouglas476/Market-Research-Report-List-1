<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polymer Neurovascular Stent Retrievers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon Expanding Stents</li><li>Self-Expanding Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Polymer Neurovascular Stent Retrievers market primarily includes two types: balloon-expanding stents and self-expanding stents. Balloon-expanding stents require an inflated balloon to achieve the desired vascular diameter, offering precise placement and support. In contrast, self-expanding stents dynamically adapt to the vessel shape upon deployment, providing continuous radial force. Both types enhance neurovascular interventions by facilitating blood flow restoration and maintaining vessel patency, effectively addressing conditions like aneurysms and arterial occlusions. Their unique mechanisms cater to diverse clinical needs.</p></p>
