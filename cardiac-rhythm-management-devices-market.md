<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Rhythm Management Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable Defibrillators</li><li>Bi Ventricular Pacemakers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiac rhythm management devices are critical for treating arrhythmias and ensuring proper heart function. Implantable defibrillators are designed to monitor heart rhythms and deliver shocks as needed to correct life-threatening conditions like ventricular fibrillation. Bi-ventricular pacemakers, on the other hand, synchronize heart contractions by stimulating both ventricles, significantly improving cardiac output in patients with heart failure. Together, these devices enhance patient quality of life, reduce hospitalizations, and minimize the risks associated with severe cardiac abnormalities.</p></p>
