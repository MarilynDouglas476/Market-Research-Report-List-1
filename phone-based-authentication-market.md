<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Phone-based Authentication Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Factor Certification</li><li>Multifactor Certification</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The phone-based authentication market comprises two main types: single-factor and multifactor authentication. Single-factor authentication relies on a single method, typically a one-time password (OTP) sent via SMS or a call, to verify a userâ€™s identity. In contrast, multifactor authentication combines multiple verification methods, such as something the user knows (a password) and something the user possesses (a phone), enhancing security by requiring multiple forms of identification. This dual-layered approach significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.</p></p>
